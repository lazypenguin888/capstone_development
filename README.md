## Title
Integration of React multi-states and UI/UX concepts behind a functional webpage

## Abstract
Behind a functional webpage involves the use of maintaining/changing states of the page, which may include data, different areas/views of the page, etc. That in conjunction with the consideration of how a user would interact with the changing states of the page to reach their purpose or goal is what completes a fully functional webpage. In this project, the goal for the user would be to view the items of a bakery and to have the option to purchase them. On the surface level, the main states of the web page consists of default (all items), different variations of items shown by the use of many different filtering/search/order options that can be used together, and displaying/redirecting to other components like the shopping cart and checkout section. To handle these different types of states of the webpage, “react states” were used by holding data of the items, shopping cart, boolean and input values, etc. These states were updated by interactions with the user and within functions of the code as many of the states are related to others, where if one is updated many other states would also be updated depending on the many different conditions. The way the states of the page can be altered are presented to the user with the thought of UI/UX concepts. For example, key concepts are what does each part of the page represent, what parts are actionable and how do they interact with each other, how does the page state flow, and for the user what are the steps in order to complete certain actions/goals. For instance one of the concepts related to this webpage, is setting up how the many different/search/order options of the items should work when combined, which is making sure every combination works and that the way it works is intuitive and assumed to the user. With the integration of multi-states and user interface / user experience concepts, a fully functional web page can be implemented.
